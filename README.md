Cool circles are being created, and they go from left to right JUST BY USING JAVASCRIPT!

They were created in p5 editor, they have functions, variables, and depeding on the mouse coordinates their color changes!
There is also a box at the bottom. The functions, variables, if else statements, and for loops are being used.
